## 🏗️ About the Project

This project demonstrates how to **optimize football player rotations** across multiple matches using **Gurobi**, a mathematical optimization solver. Coaches must consider factors such as:

- Player fatigue and physicality.
- Match difficulty.
- Goals per game.

The app ensures optimal performance over a season by using **mathematical modeling** to generate the best possible team lineup for each game.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Frontend:**
  - Choose your favorite team from a visually appealing UI.
  - Setup matches with opponent names and difficulty levels.
  - View optimized results for player rotations.

- **Backend:**
  - Solve optimization problems using Gurobi.
  - APIs to manage teams, players, and match setups.
  - Scalable architecture for advanced features.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- Gurobi Optimizer
- A modern web browser

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HIJOdelIDANII/Optimization-of-Football-Player-Rotations-Using-Gurobi.git
   cd Optimization-of-Football-Player-Rotations-Using-Gurobi
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend folder:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Run the backend server:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the frontend folder:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
